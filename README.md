# 📈 Quantitative Data Analysis & SQL Portfolio
### **Sophomore (200L) Pure Mathematics Major @ University of Lagos (UNILAG)**

## 🎯 Professional Objective
I leverage my background in **Pure Mathematics**—specifically Set Theory and Discrete Structures—to build high-integrity data models and financial analysis scripts. My goal is to transform "raw noise" into actionable business intelligence through rigorous SQL logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### [01 | Data Cleaning & Normalization](./01_Data_Cleaning)
**The "Set Integrity" Phase.** Before any analysis can happen, the data "Set" must be normalized. This folder contains scripts focused on ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
* **Logic:** Deterministic string normalization, handling NULL values, and data deduplication.
* **Key Script:** `normalize_payments.sql`

### [02 | Financial Analysis & Velocity](./02_Financial_Analysis)
**The "Momentum" Phase.** Using SQL Window Functions to model business growth and financial velocity. This is where mathematical logic meets business strategy.
* **Logic:** Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth, Revenue Velocity, and Discrete Rate of Change.
* **Key Script:** `revenue_velocity.sql`

### [03 | SQL Reps & Advanced Logic](./03_SQL_Reps_and_Logic)
**The "Logical Rigor" Phase.** A collection of complex queries demonstrating advanced problem-solving skills, including multi-table joins and recursive CTEs.
* **Logic:** Set Theory Joins, Subqueries, and Complex Data Relationships.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Languages:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Python (Learning)
* **Mathematical Foundations:** Set Theory, Real Analysis, Discrete Mathematics
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git/GitHub, Microsoft Excel

## 🚀 "Lock In" Progress
- [x] Initial Repository Architecture
- [x] Baseline Cleaning & Financial Scripts
- [ ] Integration of Real-World Datasets (Kaggle/Public Data)
- [ ] Advanced Statistical Modeling in SQL
